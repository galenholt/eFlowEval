Here, I want to just process the ANAEs into each catchment and do the standard cleanups

```{r}
system.time(
  process_anae(datIn = datDir, 
             outDir = file.path(datOut, 'ANAEcatchment'),
                        outname = 'ANAEcatchment',
                        intersections = 'ltimNoNorth',
                        commonCRS = 3577,
                        chunksave = 'ValleyName')
)

```
