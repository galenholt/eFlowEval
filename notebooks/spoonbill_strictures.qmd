## Run spoonbill strictures

```{r}
library(Rcpp)
library(RcppRoll)
library(foreach)
library(stars)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

Set directories and read-in function.

```{r}
source('directorySet.R')
source(file.path('Scripts', 'Strictures', 'RoyalSpoonbill.R'))

# parallel isn't needed
# registerDoFuture()

# plan(multisession)
```

## Check what needs to happen

The examples in the paper are only for a small set of ramsars, so just run that, rather than bother with looping. Spoonbill stricts lets us catchment-restrict, but let's not here.

```{r}

spoontime <- spoonbillstricts(c("Koondrook and Perricoota Forests", "Millewa Forest",  "Werai Forest"))
```

```{r}
spoontime
```
