## Run spoonbill strictures

```{r}
library(Rcpp)
library(RcppRoll)
library(stars)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```

Set directories and read-in function.

```{r}
source('directorySet.R')
source(file.path('Scripts', 'Strictures', 'RoyalSpoonbill.R'))

# parallel isn't needed
# registerDoFuture()

# plan(multisession)
```

## Check what needs to happen

The examples in the paper are only for the Edward Wakool, so just run that.

```{r}

spoontime <- spoonbillstricts(catchment = 'EdwardWakool')
```

```{r}
spoontime
```
